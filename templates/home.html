    <h2>Vision Statement:</h2>
    <p>
        Money! It is something that we all like, and once we earn it, we want to manage it well so we can live comfortably and save. 
        With our program <strong>DeepFinance</strong>, you have the best shot at managing your money effectively. You can enter your monthly 
        expenses, like rent or a car payment, and your monthly income to see how much you'll have left for other important purchases, 
        such as food or emergencies like a car repair. With this innovative program, you gain a new perspective on your finances—not just 
        month-to-month, but for the whole year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another great feature is saving goals. Let's say you want to save up for a $3,000 gaming computer. You can set that goal in our 
        app, and using your past income and spending data, the app can guide you to reach that goal without a major financial hit.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation:</h2>
    <p>
        In today’s world, with rising inflation and increasing living costs, managing personal finances is more important than ever. 
        As college students, we often work with tight budgets. Daily expenses like fuel, food, and commuting can add up fast—especially 
        with the return to campus or office work. These challenges inspired us to build a <strong>Finance Management System</strong> to help students 
        and young professionals track their spending, identify trends, and make smarter financial decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project addresses a real-world issue while giving us the opportunity to strengthen key software development skills like 
        database management, user interface design, and data visualization. It’s a meaningful application that helps people navigate 
        today’s financial pressures and allows us to grow our technical abilities in a practical, impactful way.
